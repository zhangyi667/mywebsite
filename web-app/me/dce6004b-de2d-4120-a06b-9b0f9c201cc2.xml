Thank you for visiting my website. I started writing this website on 6th Feb,2014 and I will keep updating until all work fine.

	<title>Summary of this website:</title>
	<content>This website is written in Grails 2.2.4, nothing is hardcoded in HTML. I only use class-based views for better code reuse. The site still needs to be improved and refined and I'm getting all these done soon.</content>

<title>Something about me:</title>
	<content>I am a Programmer with a Master degree of Computer Science, which I got in Nov,2013. I have a lot of hobbies. I love music, photograph, basketball, travelling, cooking and drinking :-). In this website you would see some pictures of my life. Currently I am living in the UK. My major skills are Grails, Groovy, Android, and, of course, Java. I am interested in Search engine and machine learning, and wish to do something cool someday:)</content>
