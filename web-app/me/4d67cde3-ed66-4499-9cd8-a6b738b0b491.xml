	<title>Summary of this website:</title>
	<content>
This website is written in Grails 2.2.4, MariaDB 5.5.34. Nothing is hardcoded in this website. Currently in this website there are 4 sections, which you can find on navigation bar. Click the tab "Albums" you can see the photos of mine, the "Notes" tab would bring you to my blogs, and the "About me" tab shows my self-intro.
